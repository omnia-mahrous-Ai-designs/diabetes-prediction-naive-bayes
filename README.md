## Project Overview
This project aims to **predict whether a person is diabetic** based on medical data using different types of **Naive Bayes classifiers**.  

The goal is to apply machine learning algorithms to **real-world classification problems** and analyze performance metrics.

---

##  Tools & Algorithms
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)  
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)  
  - Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)

---

##  Project Status
- Data cleaning and preprocessing: Completed  
- Model training: Completed  
- Model evaluation and comparison: In Progress  

---

## Results (Preliminary)
- Accuracy, precision, and recall scores have been calculated for each Naive Bayes variant  
- The models show strong performance on this dataset
